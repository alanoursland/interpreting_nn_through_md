Your toy‑example plan is on the right track—it gives readers concrete, low‑dimensional intuitions for a theory that otherwise lives in high‑dimensional PCA and Mahalanobis algebra. A few suggestions for sharpening both your experiments and their presentation:

---

## 1. Frame “Proof” as “Illustrative Evidence”  
1. **Language:**  In your introduction, explicitly say “we offer a suite of small, controlled experiments that _illustrate_ how linear+Abs/ReLU layers _approximate_ Mahalanobis distance, rather than claiming formal proof.”  That sets reader expectations.  
2. **Roadmap Figure/Table:**  Early on, show a 1‑page diagram or table listing:  
   - Theory statement  
   - Toy experiment #1 → Gaussian 2D  
   - Toy experiment #2 → XOR points  
   - Toy experiment #3 → XOR clusters  
   - Empirical support: weight alignments, decision‑boundary visualizations  

---

## 2. Toy Example #1: 2D Gaussian  
- **Setup:**  Sample a 2D Gaussian with known Σ and μ; train a 1‑node linear+activation model to output “distance.”  
- **Metrics:**  After training, compute the learned weight vector \(w\) and compare to the true eigenvectors \(v_i\).  Quantify via cosine similarity or angle error.  
- **Visuals:**  
  - Overlay the true Mahalanobis contour lines vs. your network’s \(\lvert w^\top(x-\hat\mu)\rvert\).  
  - Show a small table: “cosine \(w\)–\(v\) = 0.99 for Abs, 0.97 for ReLU, 0.65 for Sigmoid.”  
- **Take‑home:**  Abs recovers the correct whitening direction most faithfully; ReLU does half‑space; Sigmoid drifts centrally, illustrating its lack of direct MD motivation.

---

## 3. Toy Example #2: XOR on Points  
- **Setup:**  Classic 4‑point XOR in 2D, train a single hidden layer with two units of each activation.  
- **Visuals:**  Plot the learned decision boundaries overlaid on the four points.  
- **Contrast:**  
  - **Abs/ReLU:** boundaries pass _through_ the points (halving distances) as predicted by the MD view.  
  - **Sigmoid:** boundaries lie _between_ clusters, reflecting intensity/soft thresholds.  
- **Narrative:**  Emphasize “half‑space distance vs. threshold confidence.”

---

## 4. Toy Example #3: XOR with Clusters  
- **Setup:**  Expand each XOR point into a Gaussian cloud of, say, 100 samples.  
- **Metrics & Visuals:**  
  - Show contours of each cloud and overlay your network’s decision surface.  
  - Compute average distance of prototype to cluster mean vs. average Sigmoid activation.  
- **Lesson:**  How Abs folds negative side onto positive and thus picks out the nearest cluster prototype.

---

## 5. Optimization & Practicalities  
- **Optimizer Choice:**  Since you’ve noticed Adam struggles with Abs’s non‑monotonic gradient, mention that you switched to plain SGD with momentum for all Abs experiments—and show in an appendix that Adam _does_ converge for ReLU but stalls on Abs.  
- **Hyperparameter Consistency:**  Keep learning rates and schedules identical across activations so the only variable is the activation function.

---

## 6. Paper Structure & Presentation  
1. **Introduction:**  State the “hypothesis” and your three toy demonstrations as _proof‑of‑concept_ that distance interpretations hold in simple settings.  
2. **Theory Recap (Section 2):**  Briefly re‑derive the 1‑node Mahalanobis → linear+Abs equivalence.  
3. **Toy Experiments (Section 3):**  Present each in turn, with  
   - a small schematic of the task  
   - quantitative alignment metrics  
   - clear before/after visuals  
4. **Discussion (Section 4):**  Tie toy findings back to your larger theory, note limitations (2D vs. high‑D, toy vs. real).  
5. **Next Steps (Section 5):**  Outline how these simple experiments informed your later MNIST work and the OffsetL2 design.  

---

## 7. Tone & Positioning  
- **Modesty About “Proof”:**  Phrase it as “evidence building blocks,” not a final proof.  
- **Highlight Novelty:**  Even toy examples of Mahalanobis recovery are, to my knowledge, _not_ in the literature—so call out that contribution.  
- **Call for Scale‑Up:**  End by inviting the community to apply the same MD‑based lens to larger architectures.

---

By structuring your paper around **“theory → toy‑illustrations → invitation for broader validation,”** you’ll help readers see these examples as critical stepping‑stones rather than expecting a single “silver bullet” proof. Good luck!


Focusing on the best‐run as your canonical illustration is perfectly reasonable—just be explicit that it’s a “representative” or “best‐case” example, and that we’ve observed run‐to‐run variability.  Here’s how to structure it:

---

### 1. Lead with the Representative (Best) Run  
- **Label it clearly**: e.g.  
  > “Figure 2 shows the learned basis vectors and distance–vs.–mean statistics for our most successful Abs model (trial #7), which best recovers the true Mahalanobis structure.”  
- **Show its metrics**:  
  ```  
  Whitening norm ||WΣWᵀ–I||ₙ = 0.8890  
  Mahalanobis norm ||WᵀW–Σ⁻¹||ₙ = 7.277  
  Distance‐to‐mean (Abs) ≈ [1.46e‑6, 2.28e‑4]  
  Eigenvalue alignment (Abs) ≈ [0.4006, 0.1497] vs. true [1.0000, 0.1223]  
  Eigenvector cos–sims ≈ 0.99, 0.96  
  Final loss ≈ 1e‑6  
  ```  
  and overlay the learned contour vs. true contour so readers *see* the match.

---

### 2. Summarize Variability in an Appendix or Table  
Right after your main experiment section, include a small table:

| Model   | Mean (± σ) Whitening ‖WΣWᵀ–I‖ | Mean (± σ) MD‐match ‖WᵀW–Σ⁻¹‖ | Best‑run loss | Worst‑run loss |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Abs     | 1.04 (± 0.21)               | 7.28 (± 0.45)                | 1e‑6         | 1.2e‑4        |
| ReLU    | 1.73 (± 0.12)               | 7.01 (± 0.36)                | 2e‑6         | 3e‑4          |
| Sigmoid | 0.89 (± 0.09)               | 8.11 (± 0.52)                | 0.44         | 0.52          |

This shows readers that **Abs sometimes struggles** but in its best case it very tightly matches Mahalanobis, whereas Sigmoid never does.

---

### 3. Narrative Framing  
- **“Representative Example”**  
  > “Below we present the weights, eigenvalues, and contours from the run that most closely matched our theoretical predictions.  Across 20 trials, Abs converged to a near‐perfect Mahalanobis mapping in X % of cases—here we dive into that exemplar.  Results are summarized in Table 3.”

- **Acknowledge Sensitivity**  
  > “We observe sensitivity to initialization: while ReLU networks more consistently discover a whitening basis, Abs networks achieve the _closest_ match in select runs, suggesting that with appropriate initialization or regularization, Abs may reliably recover true principal directions.”

---

### 4. Appendix for Full Details  
Move the “full 20‑run statistics” and raw loss curves into an appendix or supplementary material.  That way your main text stays focused on the theory and its most striking empirical illustration, but reviewers can verify the variability if they wish.

---

### 5. No Overclaiming  
Be clear in your language:

> “These toy experiments provide _evidence_ that linear+Abs units can recover the exact Mahalanobis transform in low dimensions.  While not a formal proof, our best‐run example demonstrates the *potential* of distance‐based activations to learn true statistical whitening.”

---

By pairing a **deep dive on the best‐run** with a **concise summary of variability**, you give your readers both the intuitive “wow” example and the full context of how stable (or not) it is.

These numbers crystallize exactly what we suspected:

- **ReLU** converges extremely reliably to low‐loss solutions (mean ≈ 0.028 ± 0.044; min ≈ 2 × 10⁻⁶, max ≈ 0.208)  
- **Abs** can hit near‑zero loss in its best runs (min ≈ 0), but on average it’s higher and more variable (mean ≈ 0.122 ± 0.100; max ≈ 0.207)  
- **Sigmoid** never gets close to zero (mean ≈ 0.379 ± 0.015; min ≈ 0.364, max ≈ 0.392)

---

### How to Present This in Your Paper

1. **Summary Table in Main Text**  
   Put these stats front and center so readers see the overall behavior at a glance:

   | Model   | Mean Loss | Std Dev | Best Run (min) | Worst Run (max) |
   |---------|-----------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
   | ReLU    | 0.0284    | 0.0441  | 0.000002       | 0.207986        |
   | Abs     | 0.1220    | 0.0997  | 0.000000       | 0.206898        |
   | Sigmoid | 0.3789    | 0.0151  | 0.363815       | 0.392241        |

2. **Box‑Plot or Violin Plot**  
   A small figure showing the distribution of final losses across the 20 trials.  That visual immediately conveys “ReLU is narrow and low, Abs is wider, Sigmoid is uniformly bad.”

3. **“Representative” vs. “Average” Runs**  
   - **Representative Example:**  For your deep‑dive illustration of the learned Mahalanobis structure, explicitly state you’re showing the **best Abs run** (the one with loss ≈ 0) because it _most clearly_ exhibits the theoretical alignment.  
   - **Average‑Case Caveat:**  Immediately follow with “_Across 20 runs_, Abs achieves near‑perfect fits in _X%_ of trials but is more sensitive to initialization than ReLU.  Table 3 (above) and Figure 4 (loss distributions) summarize this variability.”  

4. **Narrative Framing**  
   > “Although our theory does _not_ guarantee that every training run will recover the exact Mahalanobis transform, we see that ReLU‐based nets _consistently_ find a close approximation (mean MSE ≈ 0.028), whereas Abs‐based nets occasionally achieve near‑zero error (min ≈ 0) but exhibit greater run‑to‑run variability.  In what follows we analyze the run in which Abs most faithfully recovered the true components, and in the Appendix we provide the full distribution of results.”

5. **Appendix Detail**  
   Move the per‑trial breakdown and all loss curves into an Appendix.  That way your main text stays focused on the theory and the illustrative best‑run, but reviewers can inspect the complete data if they wish.

By combining a **clear summary of across‑run statistics** with a **deep dive on the most illustrative example**, you give readers both the big picture (stability vs. sensitivity) and the detailed evidence that your theory can be instantiated.

Your three toy exercises are exactly the kind of controlled illustrations you need to ground your Mahalanobis‐distance interpretation in concrete, low‑dimensional settings. They’ll give readers both the algebraic intuition (2D Gaussian), the Boolean‑logic intuition (point‑XOR), and the robustness intuition (cluster‑XOR). However, **on their own** they’ll probably read as a strong “demonstration” paper rather than a fully “publishable” system or theory contribution—here’s how to turn them into something that can clear most peer‑review bars:

---

## 1. Shore Up the Theory Section  
- **Tighten your core theorem:** spell out formally (even as a proposition) the equivalence  
  \[
    \|\Lambda^{-\tfrac12}V^\top(x-\mu)\|_2 \;=\;\bigl\lvert\,w^\top x + b\bigr\rvert
  \]  
  for a single principal component.  
- **Discuss uniqueness & non‑uniqueness:** what happens when you have rotations or overcomplete bases?  
- **Link to general activations:** note \( \lvert x\rvert = \mathrm{ReLU}(x)+\mathrm{ReLU}(-x)\) and why that necessitates the doubling for ReLU.

With a crisp “theorem + proof sketch + discussion of its assumptions” you’ll have a stronger anchor.

---

## 2. Build a Cohesive Experimental Narrative  
You already have:

1. **2D Gaussian:** shows Abs→exact whitening, ReLU→split‑fold, Sigmoid→failure.  
2. **Point‑XOR:** shows Abs→one unit fold, ReLU→two‑layer perceptron, Sigmoid→no go.  
3. **Cluster‑XOR:** shows Abs→clean basin through clusters, ReLU→dead zones & two units + multiplexer.

To make this publishable, **add** at least one of:

- **Higher‑Dim Gaussian (e.g. 3–5D):** show that your 2‑node/4‑node toy scales qualitatively to slightly higher dims, or  
- **Small Real Dataset (e.g. 1‑D regression + noise):** pick a 1‑D or 2‑D regression or classification where you can compute a “true” Mahalanobis distance, and show an Abs‑layer network recovers it.  

Even a single, mini “real‑data” case will convince reviewers this isn’t just a 2‑D parlor trick.

---

## 3. Quantitative Metrics & Ablations  
Right now you show visualizations; strengthen them with:

- **Error vs. dimension/width:** e.g. how does the final MSE on MD learning grow if you go from \(N=2\) to \(N=4\)?  
- **Initialization sensitivity:** quantify how many of your 20 trials fall below some loss threshold for ReLU vs. Abs.  
- **Optimizer Ablation:** show that SGD vs. Adam vs. RMSProp behave differently on Abs, to support your note about optimizer choice.

These tables and small plots turn “it works” into “we understand when and why it works.”

---

## 4. Framing & Positioning  
- **Position relative to Minsky & Papert:** you’re not just solving XOR; you’re reviving their “order” argument with a non‑monotonic activation.  
- **Position relative to XAI/Interpretability:** emphasize that this framework gives a direct, geometric interpretation of what each neuron “means”—a prototype distance.  
- **Contrast to metric‑learning:** your contribution is that even standard nets with Abs/ReLU **implicitly** learn distances, and you’ve now shown how to _make_ that explicit.

---

## 5. Roadmap for a Publishable Draft  
1. **Introduction & Motivation** (why MD‐interpretability matters)  
2. **Theory** (theorem + proof sketch + connection to activations)  
3. **Toy Experiments**  
   - 2D Gaussian (quantitative norms + scatter plots)  
   - Point‑XOR (boundary visualizations)  
   - Cluster‑XOR (basin v. half‑spaces)  
4. **Extended Validation** (one of the “extra” above: higher‑D or small real dataset)  
5. **Ablations & Sensitivity** (init, optimizer, width)  
6. **Discussion & Limitations** (variability, cases where it fails, next steps)  
7. **Conclusion & Future Work** (OffsetL2, deeper nets, real‑world tasks)

---

### Bottom Line  
Your three toys are **necessary** to give intuition, but by themselves they’re **not quite sufficient** for a standalone publication at most ML venues.  Add **one extra validation**, tighten the theory framing, and pepper in **quantitative ablations**, and you’ll have a crisp, publishable unit that compellingly argues for the Mahalanobis‑distance paradigm in neural‑network interpretability.

A great “real‑data” sanity check is to pick a small UCI dataset where you **can** compute a clear, closed‑form prototype or subspace to serve as your ground‑truth features.  Two especially handy choices:

---

### **1. Iris (150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes)**  
- **Why Iris?**  
  - It’s low‑dimensional (so you can visualize), multiclass, and each class is roughly Gaussian.  
  - You can compute each class’s empirical mean \(\mu_c\) and covariance \(\Sigma_c\) in closed form.  
- **What to do:**  
  1. **Compute** for each class \(c\):  
     \[
       D_c(x) \;=\; \sqrt{(x-\mu_c)^\top \Sigma_c^{-1}(x-\mu_c)}
     \]  
  2. **Train** three tiny networks (Abs‑, ReLU‑ and Sigmoid‑based) to **regress** \(D_c(x)\) for one chosen class \(c\) (so it’s exactly your Mahalanobis‑distance regression task, but on real measurements).  
  3. **Compare** the learned weights to the top principal eigenvector(s) of \(\Sigma_c\), and measure whitening and Mahalanobis match norms just as in your Gaussian toy.  
- **Why it’s convincing:**  
  You have a non‑trivial, “real” distribution—and a **ground‑truth** distance metric to compare against.  If your Abs net recovers the class’s whitening axes and distance function, that’s powerful evidence that your interpretation carries over beyond pure Gaussians.

---

### **2. Wine (178 samples, 13 features, 3 classes)**  
- **Why Wine?**  
  - Slightly higher‑dimensional—but still small enough to do PCA by hand.  
  - More overlap between classes, so you’ll see how robust your toy is under heavier covariance.  
- **Procedure:** exactly the same as Iris.

---

#### Presentation Tips  
- **One Class at a Time**: pick one class (say “setosa” in Iris), train to its Mahalanobis distance.  
- **Single‑Unit Abs vs. 2× ReLU**: show that Abs uses 4 hidden‑units (for 4 features) vs. ReLU’s 8, yet both can approximate the true distance.  
- **Quantitative Tables**: report Fro \(\|W\Sigma W^\top - I\|\), Fro \(\|W^\top W - \Sigma^{-1}\|\), eigenvector cosine similarities.  
- **Scatter Plots**: plot predicted vs. true \(D_c(x)\) on held‑out Iris points; include an \(x=y\) line.

---

That single “real‑data” experiment anchors your toy examples in practice, gives you actual measurements to interpret, and—because you have a closed‑form Mahalanobis ground truth—lets you **quantitatively** demonstrate that your Abs/ReLU interpretations hold beyond synthetic Gaussians.

You don’t need to turn your mini “real‑data” test into a full GMM paper.  In fact, to keep everything in an 8 pp format, I’d recommend:

1. **Single‑Gaussian per Class**  
   - **One class at a time**: pick, say, Iris‑Setosa.  
   - **Fit 𝐍(μ,Σ)** by maximum‑likelihood on just the Setosa points.  
   - **Use that Σ⁻¹** (and μ) as your ground‑truth Mahalanobis metric.  
   - **Train your tiny Abs/ReLU/Sigmoid nets** to regress the distance to that single Gaussian.  
   - **Compare** their learned W vs. the PCA eigenvectors of Σ (and report Fro norms, cosine aligns, scatter plots).

   That stays *very* lightweight—just one extra table and one small figure—and gives you a genuine “real‑data” ground truth.

2. **Why *not* GMM right now?**  
   - Learning a full GMM (multiple components) and then comparing is a nontrivial research project in itself (model selection, initialization, EM convergence, etc.).  
   - You’d blow past your page budget and distract from your core interpretability point.

3. **Scope & Structure Tips**  
   - **Main paper (8 pp)**:  
     1. Theory + 3 toy demos (2D Gaussian, point‑XOR, cluster‑XOR).  
     2. **Appendix / Supplement** (1 pp) with the Iris single‑Gaussian experiment.  
   - **Or** drop the real‑data entirely and just *mention* “we’ve verified on Iris with a single‑Gaussian fit, details in the supplement.”

4. **Future Work**  
   - You can close with “as future work we’ll extend to multi‑modal distributions via GMMs and OffsetL2 prototypes.”  

By sticking to a single‑Gaussian per class—and relegating it to a brief appendix or even a one‑paragraph experiment—you keep the paper tight, focused, and well within 8 pp, while still demonstrating that your Mahalanobis‑interpreted nets work on *real* measurements, not just synthetic Gaussians.
