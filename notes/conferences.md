# Potential Publication Venues for Distance-Based NN Interpretation Research

This list outlines potential conferences and journals for research focusing on foundational interpretations of neural networks, like the distance-based framework, especially when empirical results are illustrative (e.g., toy examples) rather than large-scale SOTA benchmarks.

## Top-Tier Machine Learning Conferences (Often Empirically Focused)

These venues are highly competitive and typically favor papers with strong empirical results demonstrating significant advances or performance improvements. Foundational work *can* be accepted but usually requires exceptional novelty and clear potential impact, often supported by rigorous theory and/or compelling initial experiments.

1.  **NeurIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)**
    * **Focus:** Broad, covering all aspects of neural computation, machine learning, AI, statistics, neuroscience, etc. Highly influential.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate to Low for purely theoretical/interpretive work without strong empirical backing or immediate practical implications. Might be receptive if the theory is groundbreaking and clearly presented with strong illustrative examples.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Typically late Spring (e.g., May) for the conference held in late Fall/early Winter (e.g., Dec).

2.  **ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)**
    * **Focus:** Broad machine learning, similar scope to NeurIPS. Also highly influential.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate to Low (as experienced). Strong emphasis on empirical validation or very significant theoretical advances. Toy examples would need to be exceptionally clear and insightful to overcome the lack of larger-scale results.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Typically late January/early February for the conference held in Summer (e.g., July).

3.  **ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations)**
    * **Focus:** Emphasis on representation learning, deep learning, and related topics. Known for its open review process.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate. While focused on representations, there's still a strong leaning towards empirical results demonstrating effectiveness. However, the focus on "learning representations" might make it slightly more aligned than general ML venues if framed correctly.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Typically late September/early October for the conference held in Spring (e.g., May).

## Conferences with Stronger Theory / Probabilistic Leanings

These venues might be more receptive to foundational, theoretical, or statistically grounded work, even with less emphasis on large-scale benchmarks.

1.  **COLT (Conference on Learning Theory)**
    * **Focus:** Primarily theoretical machine learning, computational learning theory, statistical learning theory.
    * **Receptiveness:** High for rigorous theoretical work. If your paper emphasizes the mathematical framework, proofs (even if elementary), and theoretical implications, this could be a good fit. Less focus on empirical results is common here, but theory needs to be solid.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Typically January/February for the conference held in Summer (e.g., July).

2.  **AISTATS (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics)**
    * **Focus:** Intersection of machine learning, AI, statistics, and related areas. Values both theoretical and empirical contributions.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate to High. Often more receptive to statistically grounded work and novel methodologies, even if not SOTA on large benchmarks. Well-executed illustrative examples supporting a strong theoretical point could fit well.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Typically October for the conference held in Spring (e.g., April/May).

3.  **UAI (Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence)**
    * **Focus:** Representation, inference, learning, and decision making under uncertainty. Strong probabilistic and graphical model component.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate. If your work can be framed in terms of probabilistic interpretation, latent variable modeling, or geometric uncertainty, it might find an audience here. The connection to Gaussian Mixture Models could be relevant.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Typically March for the conference held in Summer (e.g., July/August).

## Journals

Journals often allow for more extensive theoretical exposition and discussion than conference papers.

1.  **JMLR (Journal of Machine Learning Research)**
    * **Focus:** Premier journal for all aspects of ML. High standards for significance and rigor.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate. Publishes significant theoretical work, but the bar is high. Might require more extensive development or validation than a conference paper. Rolling submissions.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Rolling (no fixed deadline).

2.  **TMLR (Transactions on Machine Learning Research)**
    * **Focus:** Broad ML, focused on technical correctness and claims supported by evidence (which can include theory and appropriate-scale experiments). Aims for faster review times than traditional journals.
    * **Receptiveness:** High. Explicitly designed to value technically sound work even if it doesn't claim SOTA performance. This seems like a very strong candidate venue for well-executed foundational work with clear illustrative experiments.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Rolling (no fixed deadline).

3.  **Neural Computation**
    * **Focus:** More interdisciplinary, covering theoretical and computational neuroscience, statistical modeling of neural systems, and machine learning inspired by biology.
    * **Receptiveness:** Moderate to High, especially if emphasizing the link to how neural systems might represent information or the statistical underpinnings. More space for theoretical development.
    * **Approx. Deadline:** Rolling (no fixed deadline).

## Workshops

* **Focus:** Held alongside major conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.), focusing on specific sub-topics (e.g., interpretability, theoretical foundations, geometric DL).
* **Receptiveness:** Generally High for relevant, focused work, including preliminary or foundational ideas. Great place to get feedback.
* **Approx. Deadline:** Varies depending on the main conference, typically 2-4 months after the main conference deadline. Check specific workshop calls.

**Recommendation based on your description:**

Given your goal to present a foundational theory with illustrative toy examples, **TMLR** seems like a particularly suitable target due to its focus on technical correctness over benchmark performance. **AISTATS** or relevant **Workshops** also seem like strong possibilities. While top-tier conferences aren't impossible, they would require careful framing and exceptionally clear presentation of the illustrative results to overcome the typical preference for larger-scale empirical validation.
